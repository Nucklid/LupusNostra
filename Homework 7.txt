abstract - visual language of shape, form, color and line to
create a composition which may exist with a degree of independence
from visual references in the world;

cubism - is an early-20th-century avant-garde art movement that
revolutionized European painting and sculpture, and inspired 
related movements in music, literature and architecture;

impressionism - is a 19th-century art movement 
characterized by relatively small, thin, yet visible brush 
strokes, open composition, emphasis on accurate depiction of 
light in its changing qualities, ordinary subject matter, 
inclusion of movement as a crucial element of human perception 
and experience, and unusual visual angles;

landscape - is the depiction of natural scenery such as 
mountains, valleys, trees, rivers, and forests, especially 
where the main subject is a wide viewâ€”with its elements 
arranged into a coherent composition;

pop art - the movement presented a challenge to traditions 
of fine art by including imagery from popular and mass culture,
such as advertising, comic books and mundane mass-produced 
cultural objects;

portrait - is a genre in painting, where the intent is to 
represent a specific human subject;

realism - sometimes called naturalism, in the arts is generally 
the attempt to represent subject matter truthfully, without 
artificiality and avoiding speculative fiction and supernatural 
elements;

My favourite styles of paintings are landscape and impressionism.
